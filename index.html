                    <h2>Justin Corr </h2>
                    <p>
                        Justin Corr is a lifelong wrestling fan who is living a dream co-hosting the Justin & Joe Wrestling Spectacular
                        Show. He
                        is a veteran broadcaster who uses the skills he’s learned in his former career to try to make the podcast
                        somewhat
                        listenable. Justin produces the show, while his partner Joe provides the insider knowledge you can’t get
                        anywhere
                        else…
                        except on Twitter and in the dirt sheets… but we’re more entertaining!
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        Justin became a fan of wrestling in the cartoon era, cheering on the likes of Macho Man Randy Savage, George
                        “the
                        Animal” Steele, and the Bushwhackers. He took a break from wrestling, thankfully, during the godawful mid-90’s.
                        But
                        he
                        was drawn back by the Monday Night Wars and has been a diehard fan ever since.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        Justin has an extensive wrestling shirt collection that boasts close to 100 tunics of the turnbuckle. He also
                        has a
                        few
                        wrestling championship belts that he’s all too proud of, considering he didn’t earn them and barely deserves to
                        hold
                        them. His wife and two sons should apply for sainthood for how accommodating they are of his fascination with
                        this
                        carnival-style stage combat sport called “professional wrestling.”

                <h2>Joe Parris</h2>
                    <p>
                        Joe Parris is an award winning journalist who happens to absolutely love professional wrestling. Joe began watching
                        wrestling from a very young age. Of course he was a major John Cena fan when he debuted on SmackDown years ago. It
                        was
                        The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin who caught Joe’s attention at a young age and kept him a fan for
                        years to come. Over the years Joe has invested himself into wrestling from all corners of the planet.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        When he realized WWE wasn’t the only wrestling promotion at the end of elementary school, his mind was blown. After
                        seeing one episode of TNA on Spike TV Joe would never look back. His wrestling watching variety now includes
                        promotions from Japan, Mexico, Canada, Germany, and the UK. His fandom evolved later in life as he became a referee
                        for an independent wrestling promotion in Denver, Colorado. Joe refereed matches including the promotion's world
                        championship match.
                        </br>
                        </br>
                        His refereeing eventually transitioned into commentating and ring announcing for the promotion. While studying
                        journalism in college Joe applied his evolving knowledge of broadcasting to his favorite hobby, professional
                        wrestling. If you ask Joe’s close friends and family, they will tell you he watches more wrestling than he probably
                        should, but Joe will tell you it certainly isn’t enough. When Justin approached Joe about launching a professional
                        wrestling podcast, the answer was immediately yes. Joe hopes to return to the ring one day with Justin Corr as his
                        tag team partner.
