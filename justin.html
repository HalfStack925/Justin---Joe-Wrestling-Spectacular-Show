            Justin Corr is a lifelong wrestling fan who is living a dream co-hosting the Justin & Joe Wrestling Spectacular Show. He
            is a veteran broadcaster who uses the skills he’s learned in his former career to try to make the podcast somewhat
            listenable. Justin produces the show, while his partner Joe provides the insider knowledge you can’t get anywhere else…
            except on Twitter and in the dirt sheets… but we’re more entertaining!
        </br>
                
            Justin became a fan of wrestling in the cartoon era, cheering on the likes of Macho Man Randy Savage, George “the
            Animal” Steele, and the Bushwhackers. He took a break from wrestling, thankfully, during the godawful mid-90’s. But he
            was drawn back by the Monday Night Wars and has been a diehard fan ever since.

            Justin has an extensive wrestling shirt collection that boasts close to 100 tunics of the turnbuckle. He also has a few
            wrestling championship belts that he’s all too proud of, considering he didn’t earn them and barely deserves to hold
            them. His wife and two sons should apply for sainthood for how accommodating they are of his fascination with this
            carnival-style stage combat sport called “professional wrestling.”
